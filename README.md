The Website
The easiest method for consuming the checklist is via our website, at: digital-defense.io

Here you can browse lists, filter by your threat model and tick items off once complete (plus, there are pretty charts to make you feel good about your progress ‚ò∫Ô∏è).

Contributing
All checklist data is stored in personal-security-checklist.yml. This is pulled in the website at build-time, and referenced by the API, and is also dynamically inserted into the markdown Checklist page.

So if you only wish to make changes to the data, this is the only file you need to edit.

Important: When submitting your pull request, provide references backing up any information that you're adding/amending/removing.

For modifying the website or API source, see the developing sections above for instructions on running locally.
